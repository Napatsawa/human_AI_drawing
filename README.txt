Project Overview

An interactive web experiment exploring how users distinguish between AI-generated and human-created images.
The project focuses on UX clarity, feedback design, and perception bias in decision-making.

Problem Statement
AI-generated images are increasingly used in marketing and media.

Users often cannot clearly distinguish between AI and human-created work.

Poor feedback design can distort perception and trust.
