Project Overview
An interactive web experiment exploring how users distinguish between AI-generated and human-created images.
The project focuses on UX clarity, feedback design, and perception bias in decision-making.

Problem Statement
  1.AI-generated images are increasingly used in marketing and media.

  2.Users often cannot clearly distinguish between AI and human-created work.

  3.Poor feedback design can distort perception and trust.

Goals
  1.Help users improve their ability to distinguish between human-created and AI-generated artwork.

  2.Provide clear post-answer explanations to reinforce learning.

  3.Reduce ambiguity in feedback to increase user confidence.

  4.Create a structured interaction flow: decision → confirmation → explanation.

Tech Stack
  1.HTML / CSS / JavaScript

  2.AI-assisted code generation with manual requirement validation

  3.Iterative UI refinement based on regression testing

What I Learned
  1.Clear feedback messaging directly affects user trust.

  2.Small UI inconsistencies significantly impact perceived product quality.

  3.AI-generated code still requires structured requirement validation.
